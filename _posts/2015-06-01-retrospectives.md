Retrospective (rèt´re-spèk-tîv) - looking back on or dealing with past events or situations.

### Why run Retrospectives

At the core of the [Agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) is the ability to reflect on feedback regularly to improve the working practices of the team to be more effective.

>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

In the Agile workplace, a retrospective is a facilitated meeting held periodically to learn from the experiences of the past sprint/iteration/project and to plan changes for the next period.

To me, a retrospective is one of the most important ceremonies in an agile team - it's the very definition of agile i.e. a team that responds to change over following a plan. It is the chance to effectively reflect on the team's practices and incorporate feedback, and hence continuously look towards improving it.

### Facilitation and Safety

A typical agenda of a retrospective can very between teams, but usually something along the following lines:

- The Prime Directive
- Safety check.
- Gather insights - collectively brainstorm about things that *worked*, things that *didn't quite work*, and *questions* that came up.
- Vote for the most important points for discussion.
- Talk about the top issues voted for.

If the facilitator has part of the story to tell, consider a different facilitator to run the retrospective.

### The Prime Directive

The prime directive of a retrospective is often stated at the very start.

> "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand"

### Safety check

Productive teams are those which have [Psychological safety](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0). It is ‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up’. Ensuring that there is safety in the room is critical. It's often a mistake to assume that there is safety in the room. An easy way to establish this is to do an anonymous poll with the participants about their comfort level about speaking up.

Participants choose from one of the following levels of safety.

1. Freebird - "I can freely express my opinions without fear of judgement".
2. Cruiser - "I can express some of my opinions freely without fear of judgement".
3. Neutral observer - "I'm a mere observer. I neither feel free nor captive".
4. Prisoner - "I do not feel at ease to express my opinions".

An anonymous poll with results tallied up will give the facilitator and the team an idea of safety. It would not be a good idea to continue a retrospective with a lot of Prisoners in the room, lest it be a silent and ineffective retrospective.

### Discussion
After gathering insights, make sure you plan enough time for discussion. Time box each discussion item to make sure you can adequately cover all topics of discussion.

Driving discussions towards getting clearly defined actionable items that can be worked on is critical. But at the same time jumping too far (deciding actions) too quickly can curb the discussion and miss the point.

These outcomes are actionable items that either team members can do or practices the team can adopt to address certain pains that come up. Be wary of unachievable and vague outcomes like 'monitor everything', instead, 'Team member X sets up automated alerts and monitoring dashboards for tracking metric Y'

### Preparation
Often retrospectives fail because the facilitator didn't put any effort to plan what they were going to do.

Here are some key points to prepare for:
Do you know how long the retrospective will be looking back? Planning to look back over 1 week will be different from 4 weeks or a month.

Make a list of topics that might come up. Especially looking out for key troublesome areas that the teams have been experiencing.

Make sure you have a good representation of the team in the room. Just having development members in a retrospective will skew what you talk about, perhaps missing important elements or points of view along the way.

Have a parking lot, for discussions that go off topic and follow it up after the retrospective.
