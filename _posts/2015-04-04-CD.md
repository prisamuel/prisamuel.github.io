Continuous Delivery (CD) practices are aimed at continuously deploying new versions of software into production in an automated way. Infrastructure as code has changed the way we think about deployment, with CD enabling the deployment of infrastructure as well. The post will focus on common principles and practices that drive CD to provide fast feedback to evaluate the effects of new code changes.

Continuous Integration has been a part of the software development lifecycle for more than a decade, and it was aimed at detecting and preventing integration problems. Taking this one step further is the idea of Continuous Delivery, where a change in the version control system triggers not only a build and validation tests, but also the capability to deploy a new version of the software into production. Continuous Deployment means that every change is automatically deployed to production. Continuous Delivery means that the team ensures every change can be deployed to production but may choose not to do it, [usually due to business reasons](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html). Here we focus on Continuous Delivery, as it is a pre-requisite to do Continuous Deployment.

The overarching principles of CD are
- visibility
- feedback
- continuous service evolution

For a simple stand-alone application, a CD pipeline might look like this:

Every change to code in a Version Control System (VCS) triggers a build, runs unit tests and integration tests, and deploys software into pre-production and production environments. We live in an era of Infrastructure As Code, and this implies that we can not only automate the build process illustrated above but also automate the infrastructure upon which software is deployed into.

In general, principles drive practices, and practices evolve into patterns. Here are four core CD principles I've observed in software delivery projects.

### Design applications for fast feedback:

In CD, feedback time is measured by the time between commiting a code change and the deployment of that change-set to production. The shorter this time is, the faster a product can respond to change. This includes the time to build, validate, and deploy the application. The validation step includes the time taken to run unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests.

Reducing time spent in tests without compromising on code quality is critical. One pattern to note here is ‘the test pyramid’ strategy – an approach to maximising the value of tests that inherently have fast feedback (e.g. unit tests) and minimising those that have a very slow feedback (e.g. browser tests, user acceptance tests).


### Service evolution without service interruption:

CD strategies must allow for a service to evolve without interruption to end users. There are two deployment patterns that allow this:
- Blue-Green (BG) deployment
- Rolling deployment

Blue-Green deployments typically have two identical production environments – where one (blue) serves out live traffic and the second one (green) is used to deploy new services into. When a deployment is complete, a DNS change switches across traffic from blue to green, and blue becoming the next deployment environment.

The second pattern - Rolling deployments, is the approach where new versions of the service are ‘silently’ deployed into production along with the existing live version and instructing the load balancer to ‘drain’ traffic over from one version to another.


### Service evolution without deployment coupling:

In real world applications, dependencies often exist between multiple services. For example, an e-commerce website might depend on a recommendation service that displays items related to the items in a user’s shopping cart. In these circumstances, services must be able to evolve independently.

Closely coupling deployments can quickly lead to complex deployment orchestrations which have a toll on feedback time.

In the scenario above, a new version of the recommendation service should be deployed without having to deploy a new e-commerce service, and vice versa. One development practice that allows independent deployment is contract testing between dependencies, and in particular, Consumer Driven Contract [CDC](http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) testing.

### Avoiding snowflake environments with immutable deployment environments:

Repeatability and reliability are key principles here. Long living deployment environments tend to become snow flakes over time. There are two deployment practices that focus on this:
- Scope the mutability of infrastructure
- Automation the deployment of infrastructure along with code

This is particularly applicable to deployment in the cloud, wherein, deployment artefacts could be the application itself (examples are jar, binaries, rpm) or docker container images (software with complete filesystem) or cloud instance images. Choosing the right scope of immutability for the deployment scenario guarantees reliability and avoids snowflakes.

Finally, irrespective of the CI/CD platform you use (Jenkins, Go CD, TeamCity, CodeShip to name a few), it's crucial to configure and set up your pipelines to provide for the above. It's driven right from the core of software design up to the deployment mechanism, hence stressing an environment with close collaboration between Developers and Operations (DevOps!).
