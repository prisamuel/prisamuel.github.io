### VP of Engineering, Dotscience, (Aug 2019 - Aug 2020) 
Technical Leadership, strategy and enablement - Led a team of exceptionally talented individuals, building an end-to- end data science platform. Ensured the team had clear technical direction, fast feedback cycles, and iterative feature development.

Making work visible - I prioritised making the engineering process “our own” i.e making it agile and flexible enough to cater for the needs of various engineering teams. I 'broadcasted' ongoing work via various channels, making sure blockers were addressed quickly, and product/UX/engineering were all in sync.

Cultivated psychological safety within the team by setting clear goals, de-stigmatising failures, inviting participation around team and technology decisions, and conflict resolution.

Supported career development and performance reviews for a team of 12 engineers. 

### Member Of Technical Staff (Jan 2018 - Aug 2020)

Co-ordinating and overseeing the overall the end-to-end architecture for services delivering the Dotscience platform. #Go #AWS #GCP #Postgres #Kubernetes

Implemented GoLang services that powered the backend of Dotscience. This comprised of multiple microservices that communicated via HTTP / GRPC to enable users to develop, build, deploy and monitor Tensorflow models.

Instrumented Terraform to automate cloud deployments, worked extensively on AWS, Google Cloud, and on-prem installs.

Kubernetes orchestration (within GKE and EKS) and managing automated deployments of cloud native applications.

Set up CI/CD and support, operational maintenance of live systems, using Drone and GitLab.

### Senior Consultant & Tech Lead, [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), London (July 2013 - present)

Experienced in leading agile software delivery teams, enabling an environment of fast feedback, continuous delivery and full stack development. I’m interested in leading teams towards a path of adopting technology best practices.

As a tech lead, my role involves shaping the architecture road map and technical stakeholder management.
Worked with large delivery projects in the retail and publishing sector. Delivered scalable web applications and worked on transforming legacy systems into [Microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html). Worked extensively on Scala/Java/GoLang Microservices written with asynchronous web frameworks.

I'm quite a generalist programmer and I work across both the Operations and Development teams - defining DevOps across teams I work with. I am actively involved in bridging the gap between Systems and Software Engineering. I strive towards setting up an environment aimed at a fast feedback and Continuous Delivery.

As a consultant I’ve worked on a varied set of frameworks and pick up skill sets that are required from project to project, and within a DevOps role I’ve worked on automating cloud deployments and maintaining infrastructure as code.
Process transformation. I work very closely with teams to refine processes iteratively and create opportunities for feedback.

### Senior Developer, GenieDB, London, UK & San Juan Capistrano, CA, USA (Aug 2009 – Apr 2013)

Worked in a small startup team implementing an event driven distributed NoSQL database engine (primarily in C++), which plugs into MySQL on the front-end and uses Berkeley DB as it’s internal storage engine.  The system had challenges unique to distributed software – primarily, concurrent resource accesses and their overhead on performance. Identified and resolved bottlenecks and delivered exceptional performance benchmarks.

**Software lifecycle management.** I was involved in driving the design, implementation and testing cycles. I integrated subsystems and automated builds with a Continuous Integration server to deliver short iterative life-cycles, set up automated test scripts which feed results back into the development cycle. Any regressions were immediately visible and this reduced the time taken to deliver feature requests.

Added value to the intellectual capital within the organisation. Responsible for the design and development of core components in the software.

**Trained and mentored** new interns and nurtured a fun and performance driven work culture.

### IBM (Aug 2007 - Aug2008), Graduate Associate Systems Engineer

Worked as a part of a DBA Team for a major client in the automobile sector. We conducted Disaster Recovery Tests on clients’ databases that were hosted across multiple continents.

### OpenSource
Contributor to [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/) (Open Medical Records Systems), an open source platform for improving the management of health care information. Widely deployed in Africa and India.

Extended a common open source Java testing tool called “Coverlipse”. It analyzes the coverage of code in JUnit tests in terms of lines, code paths, branches, and generates a visual output of code coverage.

Programmed tools for analyzing of large amounts of data, for automation of tasks, and in general, to make life easier. Setting up networks and infrastructure has always been a hobby.

### Research and Academic work

* Research intern (Biophysics Lab) at The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) (Dec 2006 - April 2007)

* Worked on a project aimed at searching large datasets for patterns and analysing statistical data in Bioinformatics.

* Worked on writing modeling tools in Unix to map interactions in proteins, thereby deriving visual models of protein structures: My work has been published in the Indian Journal of Multidisciplinary Research [Ind. J. Multi. Res. 2007. Vol. 3 (1) : 105 – 110.]

* Pseudo-code Design: Presented a paper titled ‘A new approach to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool’ at Helix ’05, National level symposium on the emerging trends in Bioinformatics.
